  <h2>My solo project with Spring Boot </h2>

  <p> 
I have created an intuitive job management application. Users can seamlessly add diverse job listings and select from various opportunities available on the dashboard. Once a user completes a job, they can easily remove it from their list. Additionally, users have the ability to view and update details for each job</p>
